The tool try to reduce the effort to publish a SPM-based Package to Cocoapods.
Currently, to convert SPM package to Cocoapods, it needs following steps:
1. Invoke `pod lib create` , it will create a folder that contains a basic Pods library with interactively command.
2. To make the library work, it need update some git/spm information into the {Library}.podspec manually. 
3. It need to add dependency manually.

To reduce those efforts, Pcakage2Pods read some information from the SPM package and its git repo. and convert and append those information to given template podspec.
currently, it collects and updates following information into podspec:
1. Package Name, Platforms, Swift Tool Version and dependencies from Swift Package.
2. User name, email, repo url (with the scheme "https"), and the latest tag from git.

## Usage

### Workflow to create Cocoapods from SPM package

1. Create and write SPM package
2. Push the package to remote repo and release it by assign a tag.
3. In the root of the package(which should contains a Package.Swift file), execute pcakge-to-pods to create ${Package Name}.podspec
4. Open the ${Package Name}.podspec, check and update `s.summary`, `s.description`, `s.homepage`, and `s.license` if necessary.
5. Execute `pod lib lint` to check if there is any error need to be fixed. (normally, it might need update the dependency name to related pod)
